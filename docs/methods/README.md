# Statistical Methods Documentation

This directory contains detailed methodology documentation for the statistical methods implemented in DesignPower.

## Organization

The documentation is organized by study design and outcome type, matching the structure of the application:

1. **Parallel RCT**
   - [Continuous Outcomes](parallel_rct_continuous.md)
   - [Binary Outcomes](parallel_rct_binary.md)
   - [Survival Outcomes](parallel_rct_survival.md)

2. **Single-Arm Trials**
   - [Continuous Outcomes](single_arm_continuous.md)
   - [Binary Outcomes](single_arm_binary.md)
   - [A'Hern Design for Phase II Trials](ahern_design.md)

3. **Cluster RCT**
   - [Continuous Outcomes](cluster_rct_continuous.md)
   - [Binary Outcomes](cluster_rct_binary.md)

4. **Special Topics**
   - [Repeated Measures Designs](repeated_measures.md)
   - [Simulation Methods](simulation_methods.md)

## Calculation Types

Each document describes the methodology for all three calculation types:
- Sample Size Calculation
- Power Calculation
- Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) Calculation
