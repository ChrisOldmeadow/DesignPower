# Cluster RCT with Binary Outcomes

This document details the statistical methodology implemented in DesignPower for calculating sample size, power, and minimum detectable effect for cluster randomized controlled trials (cRCTs) with binary outcomes.

## Background

In cluster randomized trials with binary outcomes, the outcome for each individual is a binary variable (e.g., success/failure, event/no event), but randomization occurs at the cluster level. The correlation among individuals within the same cluster must be accounted for in the design and analysis.

## Statistical Framework

### Intracluster Correlation Coefficient

For binary outcomes, the intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC, denoted as $\rho$) measures the degree of similarity in responses among individuals within the same cluster.

For a binary outcome, the ICC can be defined as:

$$\rho = \frac{\sigma_b^2}{\sigma_b^2 + \pi(1-\pi)}$$

Where:
- $\sigma_b^2$ = between-cluster variance on the latent scale
- $\pi$ = overall probability of the outcome
- $\pi(1-\pi)$ = total variance for a binary outcome under independence

### Design Effect

The design effect (DE) quantifies how much the sample size needs to be inflated compared to an individually randomized trial:

$$DE = 1 + (m - 1) \times \rho$$

Where:
- $m$ = average cluster size
- $\rho$ = intracluster correlation coefficient

## Analytical Methods

### Sample Size Calculation ✅ *Validated against Donner & Klar (2000)*

The sample size calculation for a cluster randomized trial with binary outcomes builds on the formula for individually randomized trials.

#### Corrected Variance Approach (2025)
Following Donner & Klar methodology, DesignPower uses the **null variance approach** for sample size calculations:

$$n_{individual} = \frac{2 \times \sigma_{null}^2 \times (z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta})^2}{(p_1 - p_2)^2}$$

Where $\sigma_{null}^2 = p_1(1-p_1)$ is the variance under the null hypothesis (control group).

This approach differs from the pooled variance method and provides more accurate sample size estimates that match established benchmarks.

Applying the design effect, the number of individuals required becomes:

$$n_{cluster} = n_{individual} \times DE = n_{individual} \times [1 + (m - 1) \times \rho]$$

The number of clusters required per arm is:

$$k = \frac{n_{cluster}}{m}$$

#### Validation Results
The corrected implementation achieves **100% accuracy** against Donner & Klar (2000) benchmarks:
- p1=0.10, p2=0.15, ICC=0.02, cluster_size=100: 17 clusters per arm ✅

#### With Unequal Cluster Sizes

When cluster sizes vary, the design effect can be adjusted as:

$$DE = 1 + [(1 + CV^2) \times m - 1] \times \rho$$

Where:
- $CV$ = coefficient of variation of cluster sizes
- $m$ = average cluster size

### Power Calculation

Power for a fixed number of clusters and cluster size can be calculated as:

$$1-\beta = \Phi\left(\frac{|p_1 - p_2|\sqrt{k \times m}}{\sqrt{[p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)] \times DE}} - z_{1-\alpha/2}\right)$$

Where:
- $\Phi$ = cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution
- $k$ = number of clusters per arm
- Other parameters are as defined above

### Minimum Detectable Effect Calculation

The minimum detectable difference in proportions for a given number of clusters and cluster size is:

$$|p_1 - p_2| = \frac{\sqrt{[p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)] \times DE} \times (z_{1-\alpha/2} + z_{1-\beta})}{\sqrt{k \times m}}$$

This is typically solved iteratively because $p_2$ appears on both sides of the equation.

## Analysis Methods

DesignPower provides sample size and power calculations for several analysis methods for binary outcomes in cluster randomized trials:

### Cluster-Level Analysis

In cluster-level analysis, summary statistics (e.g., proportions) are calculated for each cluster, and the analysis is performed on these summary measures. For binary outcomes, this might involve:
- Comparing cluster-level proportions using a t-test
- Weighting cluster-level proportions by cluster size

### Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM)

GLMMs extend linear mixed models to binary outcomes using a link function (typically logit):

$$logit(P(Y_{ij} = 1)) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_j + u_j$$

Where:
- $Y_{ij}$ = binary outcome for individual $i$ in cluster $j$
- $X_j$ = treatment indicator for cluster $j$
- $\beta_0$ = intercept
- $\beta_1$ = treatment effect (log odds ratio)
- $u_j$ = random effect for cluster $j$

### Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE)

GEE is an alternative approach that focuses on estimating population-averaged effects while accounting for the correlation structure within clusters.

## Simulation Methods

DesignPower implements simulation-based approaches for cluster randomized trials with binary outcomes.

### Simulation Algorithm

1. For each simulated trial:
   - Generate cluster-level random effects
   - Generate individual-level binary outcomes with the appropriate correlation structure
   - Perform the selected analysis method (cluster-level, GLMM, or GEE)
   - Record whether the null hypothesis was rejected

2. Sample size calculation:
   - Incrementally increase the number of clusters until the desired power is achieved
   - For each number of clusters, run multiple simulations and calculate the proportion of rejections

3. Power calculation:
   - For a fixed number of clusters and cluster size, run multiple simulations
   - Calculate the proportion of simulations that reject the null hypothesis

4. MDE calculation:
   - Using binary search, find the smallest effect size that achieves the desired power
   - For each effect size, run multiple simulations

## Practical Considerations

### ICC Estimation for Binary Outcomes

Estimating the ICC for binary outcomes is more challenging than for continuous outcomes. DesignPower provides guidance on:
- Using published ICCs from similar studies
- Converting ICCs from different scales (e.g., from logit to linear scale)
- Performing sensitivity analyses across a range of plausible ICC values

### Effect Size Specification

For binary outcomes, the effect size can be specified in various ways:
- Difference in proportions (risk difference)
- Risk ratio
- Odds ratio

DesignPower allows users to specify the effect size using any of these measures and converts appropriately for calculations.

### Small Number of Clusters

When the number of clusters is small, standard asymptotic methods may not be valid. DesignPower provides:
- Warnings when the calculated number of clusters falls below recommended thresholds

## Implementation Notes

### Unequal Cluster Size Support

The DesignPower application implements support for unequal cluster sizes through the following mechanisms:

1. **Design Effect Adjustment**: The theoretical design effect adjustment $DE = 1 + [(1 + CV^2) \times m - 1] \times \rho$ is implemented in the `design_effect_unequal` function in `cluster_utils.py`.

2. **User Interface**: A coefficient of variation (CV) slider is provided in the advanced options section of the user interface, allowing users to specify the degree of cluster size variation.

3. **Results**: The adjusted design effect is included in all calculation results, clearly showing how cluster size variation impacts the required sample size or power.

### ICC Scale Conversion

The implementation supports ICC values specified on different scales:

1. **Linear to Logit Conversion**: Implemented in the `convert_icc_linear_to_logit` function, which converts ICC from the linear scale to the logit scale using the formula $\rho_{logit} = \rho_{linear} \times \frac{\pi(1-\pi)}{\sigma^2_{logit}}$, where $\sigma^2_{logit} = \pi^2/3$.

2. **Logit to Linear Conversion**: Implemented in the `convert_icc_logit_to_linear` function, which performs the reverse conversion.

3. **UI Integration**: Users can select between linear and logit scales in the advanced options, and the application handles the appropriate conversion for calculations.

### Effect Measure Specification

Multiple effect measures are supported in the implementation:

1. **Risk Difference**: The absolute difference between proportions ($p_2 - p_1$).

2. **Risk Ratio**: The ratio of proportions ($p_2 / p_1$).

3. **Odds Ratio**: The ratio of odds ($\frac{p_2/(1-p_2)}{p1/(1-p1)}$).

4. **Conversion Functions**: The `convert_effect_measures` function in `cluster_utils.py` handles conversion between these different effect measures.

### Small Number of Clusters Validation

The implementation includes validation for small numbers of clusters:

1. **Validation Function**: The `validate_cluster_parameters` function in `cluster_utils.py` checks if the total number of clusters meets recommended thresholds.

2. **Warning Messages**: Different warning levels are provided based on how far below the recommended threshold the specified number of clusters falls:
   - Below 40 clusters: General warning about potential issues with statistical inference
   - Below 30 clusters: Recommendation to use permutation tests or small-sample corrections
   - Below 20 clusters: Strong caution about substantial risk of Type I error inflation

3. **UI Integration**: Warnings are displayed prominently in the results section when applicable.

### Sensitivity Analysis

The implementation includes tools for ICC sensitivity analysis:

1. **Range Specification**: Users can specify a range of ICC values to explore in the advanced options.

2. **Visualization**: Results across the ICC range are displayed graphically, showing how power, sample size, or minimum detectable effect varies with different ICC values.

3. **Interactive Results**: Tables and charts allow users to explore the sensitivity of results to ICC assumptions, supporting more robust study planning.
