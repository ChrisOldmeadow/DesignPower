# Project TODO List

- [ ] **Investigate `statsmodels` `MixedLM` Warnings**:
    - Review warnings (singular covariance, convergence failures, Hessian not positive definite) generated by `statsmodels.MixedLM` during the tests in `tests/core/designs/cluster_rct/test_simulation_continuous.py`.
    - Determine if these warnings indicate issues with the simulated data, model specification, or if they can be mitigated by adjusting model parameters or data generation. This will improve the reliability of the `MixedLM` analysis results.
- [ ] **Enhance Bayesian Simulation Details**:
    - Update `simulate_continuous_trial` (in `core/designs/cluster_rct/simulation_continuous.py`) to return more detailed information from the Stan fit when the model converges successfully (e.g., key parameters from `fit.summary()`, or convergence diagnostics like R-hat values).
    - Update the corresponding tests in `test_simulation_continuous.py` to check for this richer information.
- [ ] **Review and Update CmdStan Documentation**:
    - Ensure project documentation (if any exists for local setup or advanced usage) accurately reflects the CmdStan installation process, the use of `cmdstanpy`, and the `statsmodels` dependency.
