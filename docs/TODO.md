# Project TODO List

- [ ] **Develop Unified Master CLI Tool**:
    - Design and implement a comprehensive command-line interface (e.g., `designpower-cli <design> <outcome> --param1 val1 ...`) for the entire DesignPower application.
    - This reflects the project's original CLI-centric design and provides an alternative to generating individual scripts for each calculation.

- [ ] **Investigate `statsmodels` `MixedLM` Warnings**:
    - Review warnings (singular covariance, convergence failures, Hessian not positive definite) generated by `statsmodels.MixedLM` during the tests in `tests/core/designs/cluster_rct/test_simulation_continuous.py`.
    - Determine if these warnings indicate issues with the simulated data, model specification, or if they can be mitigated by adjusting model parameters or data generation. This will improve the reliability of the `MixedLM` analysis results.
- [ ] **Enhance Bayesian Simulation Details**:
    - Update `simulate_continuous_trial` (in `core/designs/cluster_rct/simulation_continuous.py`) to return more detailed information from the Stan fit when the model converges successfully (e.g., key parameters from `fit.summary()`, or convergence diagnostics like R-hat values).
    - Update the corresponding tests in `test_simulation_continuous.py` to check for this richer information.
- [ ] **Review and Update CmdStan Documentation**:
    - Ensure project documentation (if any exists for local setup or advanced usage) accurately reflects the CmdStan installation process, the use of `cmdstanpy`, and the `statsmodels` dependency.
- [ ] **Improve Test Coverage**:
    - Review the overall test coverage (currently ~35%).
    - Identify modules and functions with low coverage (e.g., many parts of `core/designs/parallel/`, `core/designs/single_arm/`, `core/outcomes/`, `core/utils/`).
    - Prioritize and write new unit tests to increase coverage for critical components.
