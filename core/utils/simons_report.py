    Sample Size Calculation Report (Simon's Two-Stage Design):
    
    A {design_type.lower()} two-stage design was calculated with the following characteristics:
    
    Stage 1: Enroll {n1} patients. If {r1} or fewer responses are observed, stop the trial for futility.
    Stage 2: If continuing, enroll {n - n1} additional patients (total n = {n}).
    
    The null hypothesis of response rate â‰¤ {p0:.2f} will be rejected if more than {r} total responses 
    are observed. This design provides {actual_power * 100:.1f}% power to detect a true response rate 
    of {p1:.2f} while controlling the Type I error rate at {actual_alpha * 100:.2f}%.
    
    The probability of early termination under the null hypothesis is {PET0 * 100:.1f}%, with an 
    expected sample size of {EN0:.1f} patients under the null hypothesis.
    
    Simon's two-stage design allows for early stopping for futility, potentially saving resources 
    if the treatment is not effective.
