## Conclusion

DesignPower demonstrates strong validation for core statistical methods against authoritative sources, with particular strength in single-arm and cluster RCT designs. However, the application layer requires significant remediation, with critical failures in component integration and test coverage. The immediate priority is fixing the failing test suite to ensure reliable functionality across all features.

The validation framework provides a solid foundation for ongoing quality assurance, but requires immediate attention to resolve the current crisis in test reliability before expanding validation coverage to additional statistical methods.
