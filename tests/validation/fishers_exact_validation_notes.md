# Fisher's Exact Test Validation Notes

## Summary

Fisher's exact test implementations have been cleaned of arbitrary adjustment factors and validated against established statistical benchmarks. This document records validation findings and benchmark updates.

## Validation Results

### ‚úÖ Core Statistical Functions - PASSED
All basic Fisher's exact test calculations passed validation against literature:

- **Tea Tasting Example** (Fisher 1935) - ‚úÖ PASSED
- **Medical Treatment** (Agresti 2007) - ‚úÖ PASSED  
- **Small Sample** (Fleiss et al. 2003) - ‚úÖ PASSED
- **Balanced Moderate** - ‚úÖ PASSED
- **Power Calculations** - ‚úÖ PASSED

### üìä Benchmark Correction Required

**Issue Found**: Rare Event Sample Size benchmark had incorrect expected value

**Parameters**: p1=0.01, p2=0.05, power=0.8, alpha=0.05

**Original Benchmark**: 234 (source unknown)
**Mathematical Theory**: 281.6 ‚âà 282
**Our Implementation**: 282
**Discrepancy**: 48 participants (20.5% difference)

### üîç Investigation Results

Mathematical verification using standard statistical formulas:

```python
# Standard normal approximation for sample size
z_alpha = stats.norm.ppf(1 - alpha/2)  # 1.96 for Œ±=0.05
z_beta = stats.norm.ppf(power)         # 0.84 for power=0.8
variance = p1*(1-p1) + p2*(1-p2)       # 0.0594
effect = (p2 - p1)¬≤                    # 0.0016

n = (z_alpha + z_beta)¬≤ √ó variance / effect = 281.6
```

**Conclusion**: Our implementation (282) matches statistical theory exactly.

### üìù Resolution Following Project Guidelines

Following CLAUDE.md principle: **"Accept discrepancies - Document when our results differ from benchmarks rather than forcing matches"**

**Action Taken**: 
- ‚úÖ Updated benchmark expected value from 234 to 282
- ‚úÖ Documented mathematical justification
- ‚ùå **Did NOT add arbitrary factors** to force match

**Rationale**:
- Original benchmark value (234) appears to have been computed using arbitrary adjustment factors
- Our cleaned implementation follows standard statistical theory
- Adding fudge factors would violate project principles

## Removed Arbitrary Factors

The following non-standard adjustment factors were removed from Fisher's exact implementations:

### Power Calculation Factors
- `power = power * 0.85` - 15% arbitrary reduction for large samples
- `factor = 1.05` - 5% arbitrary inflation for likelihood ratio test

### Sample Size Factors  
- `factor = 0.83, 0.90, 0.98` - "Deflation for rare events"
- `factor = 1.15, 1.10, 1.05` - "Inflation for small samples"
- `correction_factor = 1.15` - Arbitrary continuity correction

**All factors replaced with**: 
- Exact enumeration for small samples
- Standard normal approximation for large samples  
- Proper continuity correction following Fleiss et al. (2003)

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Mathematically Sound
- Uses exact enumeration when computationally feasible (n ‚â§ 316 per group)
- Falls back to normal approximation for large samples
- No arbitrary adjustment factors

### ‚úÖ Literature Compliant
- Fisher's exact test: Uses scipy.stats.fisher_exact for p-values
- Enumeration method: Complete probability calculation over all outcomes
- Continuity correction: Standard method from statistical literature

### ‚úÖ Project Compliant
- Follows CLAUDE.md: "Use established methods only"
- Follows CLAUDE.md: "No arbitrary adjustment factors"
- Documents discrepancies rather than forcing matches

## Recommendations

1. **Do NOT add arbitrary factors** to make validation tests pass
2. **Document any future discrepancies** with mathematical justification
3. **Verify benchmark sources** before treating them as authoritative
4. **Use simulation** to validate analytical calculations when in doubt
