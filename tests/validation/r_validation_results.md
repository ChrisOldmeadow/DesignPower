## Detailed Validation Results

### Parallel Group Continuous Outcomes ✅ **PERFECT MATCH**

**Validation against R pwr package**

Our continuous RCT implementation shows perfect agreement with R's `pwr.t.test()` function across multiple parameter combinations:

**Test Case 1:** Standard Effect Size
- **Parameters:** μ₁=100, μ₂=110, σ=15, α=0.05, power=0.8
- **Effect Size:** Cohen's d = 0.667 (medium-large effect)
- **DesignPower Result:** n=37 per group
- **R pwr Result:** n=37 per group  
- **Error:** 0.0% ✅

**Test Case 2:** High Power Scenario
- **Parameters:** μ₁=50, μ₂=60, σ=20, α=0.01, power=0.9
- **Effect Size:** Cohen's d = 0.5 (medium effect)
- **DesignPower Result:** n=121 per group
- **R pwr Result:** n=121 per group
- **Error:** 0.0% ✅

**Technical Analysis:**
- Both implementations use identical formulas for Cohen's d effect size calculation
- Both apply normal approximation for large samples
- Our t-distribution refinement doesn't differ from R's approach for these parameter ranges
- Perfect agreement validates our methodological implementation

### Parallel Group Binary Outcomes ⏳ **PENDING VALIDATION**

**Target R Packages:**
1. **pwr package** - Uses Cohen's h effect size transformation
2. **Hmisc package** - Direct proportion-based calculations
3. **epiR package** - Epidemiological effect measures

**Anticipated Results:**
- Expected good agreement (≤5% error) with pwr package using Cohen's h
- May see differences with direct proportion methods due to continuity corrections
- Will test both with and without continuity correction options

### Single-arm Designs ⏳ **PENDING VALIDATION**

**Key Testing Areas:**
1. **One-sided vs Two-sided Tests:**
   - R pwr.p.test default is two-sided
   - Our validation showed single-arm trials should use one-sided
   - Will test both approaches and document differences

2. **Exact vs Approximate Methods:**
   - Compare our exact binomial with R's normal approximation
   - Test gsDesign package for exact calculations
   - Validate against A'Hern and Simon designs

### Cluster Randomized Trials ⏳ **HIGH PRIORITY VALIDATION**

**clusterPower Package Comparison:**
- **Objective:** Resolve Eldridge benchmark discrepancy
- **Test Parameters:** Same as failing Eldridge example
- **Expected Outcome:** Identify if R clusterPower agrees with our Donner & Klar approach
- **Investigation Focus:**
  - Design effect formula differences
  - ICC interpretation variations  
  - Alternative methodological approaches

## Parameter Range Analysis

### Validation Strategy

To ensure robust validation across clinical trial scenarios, we test parameter ranges covering:

**Effect Sizes:**
- Small effects (Cohen's d = 0.2, risk difference = 0.05)
- Medium effects (Cohen's d = 0.5, risk difference = 0.15)  
- Large effects (Cohen's d = 0.8, risk difference = 0.25)

**Power Levels:**
- Standard: 80%, 90%
- High: 95%
- Lower: 70%

**Significance Levels:**
- Standard: α = 0.05
- Stringent: α = 0.01
- Liberal: α = 0.10

**Sample Size Ranges:**
- Small studies: n = 10-50 per group
- Medium studies: n = 50-200 per group
- Large studies: n = 200+ per group

### Identified Methodological Differences

**Expected Differences and Explanations:**

1. **t-distribution vs Normal Approximation:**
   - Our implementation: Uses t-critical values with estimated df
   - R pwr: Uses normal approximation
   - **Impact:** Minimal for large samples, slightly more conservative for small samples

2. **Continuity Corrections:**
   - Our implementation: Optional continuity correction for binary outcomes
   - R packages: Variable defaults across packages
   - **Impact:** Can cause ±5-10% differences in sample size

3. **Exact vs Approximate:**
   - Our A'Hern/Simon: Exact binomial probabilities
   - R approximations: May use normal approximations
   - **Impact:** Should favor our exact methods for accuracy

4. **Design Effect Formulas:**
   - Our implementation: Standard Donner & Klar DE = 1 + (m-1)×ICC
   - Alternative formulations: Variance inflation factors, different ICC definitions
   - **Impact:** Could explain cluster RCT discrepancies
